I was born in 67
The year of Sgt Pepper
And Are You Experienced
Into a suburban heaven
Yeah it shouldve been forever
It all seems to make so much sense
But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies
She said luck is what you make it
You just reach out and take it
Now lets dance a while
She said nothing ever happens
If you dont make it happen
And if you cant laugh and smile
But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies
And laughing in the summer showers
Thats still the way I see you now
How does time break down
With no marker things slow down
A conference of the strange
And your family is deranged
I could tell you what Im thinking
While we sit here drinking
But Im not sure where to start
You see theres something wrong here
Im sorry if Im not clear
Can you stop smoking your cigar
But after a while
You realize time flies
And the best thing that you can do
Is take whatever comes to you
Cause time flies
And the coat you wore to Alton Towers
Is still the way I see you now
