A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
Im saying nothing
But Im saying nothing with feel
I simply am not here
No way I
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please
And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of there must be more
So dont breathe here
Dont leave your bags
I simply am not here
No way I
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please
The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And Im zoning out
Im watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
Im totally bored
But I cant switch off
Only apathy
From the pills in me
Its all in me all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
Its all in me all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy
Were lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores
Like zombies
Well what is the point
What can money buy
My hands on a gun and I find the range
God tempt me
Well what did you say
Think Im passing out
Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
I smiled into the sun
The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldnt hear you
You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen
Theres black across the sun
