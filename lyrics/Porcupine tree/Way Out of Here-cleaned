Out at the train tracks
I dream of escape
But a song comes onto my iPod
And I realize its getting late
I cant take the staring and the sympathy
And I dont like the questions
How do you feel Hows it going in school
Do you want to talk about it
Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out Vanish
Ill try to forget you
And I know that I will
In a thousand years or maybe a week
Ill burn all your pictures cut out your face
And the shutters are down and the curtains are closed
And Ive covered my tracks
Disposed of the car and Ill try to forget even your name
And the way that you look when youre sleeping
Dreaming of this
Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out Vanish
Way out
Way out of here
Fade out
Fade out Vanish
