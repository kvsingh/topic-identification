A good impression of myself
Not much to conceal
I'm saying nothing
But I'm saying nothing with feel

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please

And because of who we are
We react in mock surprise
The curse of "there must be more"
So don't breathe here
Don't leave your bags

I simply am not here
No way I...
Shut up be happy
Stop whining please

The dust in my soul
Makes me feel the weight in my legs
My head in the clouds
And I'm zoning out
I'm watching TV
But I find it hard to stay conscious
I'm totally bored
But I can't switch off

[Hook]
Only apathy
From the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Electricity from the pills in me
It's all in me, all in you
Only MTV and cod philosophy

We're lost in the mall
Shuffling through the stores
Like zombies
Well what is the point?
What can money buy?
My hands on a gun and I find the range
God tempt me
Well what did you say?
Think I'm passing out

[Hook]

Water so warm that day
I counted out the waves
As they broke into surf
I smiled into the sun

The water so warm that day
I was counting out the waves
And I followed their short life
As they broke on the shoreline
I could see you
But I couldn't hear you

You were holding your hat in the breeze
Turning away from me
In this moment you were stolen
There's black across the sun
