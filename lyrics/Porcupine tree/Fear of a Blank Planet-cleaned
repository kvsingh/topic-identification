Sunlight coming through the haze
No gaps in the blind to let it inside
The bed is unmade some music still plays
TV yeah its always on
The flicker of the screen a movie actress screams
Im basking in the shit flowing out of it
Im stoned in the mall again
Terminally bored shuffling round the stores
And shoplifting is getting so last years thing
XBox is a god to me
A finger on the switch my mother is a bitch
My father gave up ever trying to talk to me
Dont try engaging me
The vaguest of shrugs the prescription drugs
So youll never find a person inside
My face is mogadon
Curiosity has given up on me
Im tuning out desires the pills are on the rise
How can I be sure Im here
The pills that Ive been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
Theres nothing left I simply am not here
Im through with pornography
The acting is lame the action is tame
Explicitly dull Arousal annuled
Your mouth should be boarded up
Talking all day with nothing to say
Your shallow proclaims all misinformation
My friend says he wants to die
Hes in a band  they sound like Pearl Jam
The clothes are all black the music is crap
In school I dont concentrate
And sex is kinda fun but just another one
Of all the empty ways of using up a day
How can I be sure Im here
The pills that Ive been taking confuse me
I need to know that someone sees that
Theres nothing left I simply am not here
Bipolar disorder
Cant deal with boredom
Bipolar disorder
Cant deal with boredom
You dont try to be liked
You dont mind you feel no sun
You steal a gun to kill time
Youre somewhere youre nowhere
You dont care you catch the breeze
You still the leaves so now where
