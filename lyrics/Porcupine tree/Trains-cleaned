Train set and match spied under the blind
Shiny and contoured the railway winds
And Ive heard the sound from my cousins bed
The hiss of the train at the railway head
Always the summers are slipping away
A sixty ton angel falls to the earth
Pile of old metal a radiant blur
Scars in the country the summer and her
Always the summers are slipping away
Find me a way for making it stay
When I hear the engine pass Im kissing you wide
The hissing subsides Im in luck
When the evening reaches here youre tying me up
Im dying of love its OK
