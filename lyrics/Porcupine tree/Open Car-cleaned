Nothing like this
Felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm
Lost in her arms
I keep a photograph
Give me a glimpse
Let me come in
Be there inside her
Here it begins
Here is the sin
Something to lie about
You think youre smart
I think youre art
We agree on this
It doesnt work
Feeling like dirt
Feeling like you dont care
We get a room
And in the gloom
She lights a cigarette
Clothes on the bed
Love me she said
I gave myself to her
Im getting feelings Im hiding too well
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
Hair blow in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
OK whats next
After the sex
What do we do now
Finding the time
Drawing the line
And never crossing it
Gave her the hours
Gave her the power
Cannot erase her
Gave her the truth
Gave her the proof
I gave her everything
Im getting feelings Im hiding too well
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
On a drive out to the farm
Hair blown in an open car
Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down your arm
Hair blown in an open car
