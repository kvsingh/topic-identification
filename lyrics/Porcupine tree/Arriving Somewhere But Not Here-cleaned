Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mothers eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river rushing through your ears
Arriving somewhere but not here
Did you imagine the final sound as a gun
Or the smashing windscreen of a car
Did you ever imagine the last thing youd hear as youre fading out was a song
Arriving somewhere but not here
All my designs simplified
And all of my plans compromised
All of my dreams sacrificed
Guitar solo
Ever had the feeling youve been here before
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins and all you knew was wrong
Arriving somewhere but not here
All my designs simplified
And all of my plans compromised
All of my dreams 
Guitar solo
Did you see the red mist block your path
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart
Did you feel the envy for the sons of mothers tearing you apart
