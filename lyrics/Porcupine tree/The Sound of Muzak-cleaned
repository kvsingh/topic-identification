Hear the sound of music drifting in the aisles
Elevator prozac stretching on for miles
The music of the future will not entertain
Its only meant to repress and neutralise your brain
Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want
One of the wonders of the world is going down
Its going down I know
Its one of the blunders of the world that noone cares
Noone cares enough
Now the sound of music comes in silver pills
Engineered to suit you building cheaper thrills
The music of rebellion makes you wanna rage
But its made by millionaires who are nearly twice your age
Soul gets squeezed out
Edges get blunt
Demographic
Gives what you want
One of the wonders of the world is going down
Its going down I know
Its one of the blunders of the world that noone cares
Noone cares enough
