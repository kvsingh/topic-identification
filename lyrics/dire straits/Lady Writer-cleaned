Lady writer on the TV
Talking about the Virgin Mary
Reminded me of you
Expectation left to come up to yeah
Lady writer on the TV
Yeah she had another quality
The way you used to look
And I know you never read a book
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She had all the brains and the beauty
The picture does not fit
Youd talk to me when you felt like it
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Another time another place
Yes and your rich old man
You know hed a call her a dead ringer
You got the same command
Plus your mother was a Jazz singer
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face
And I recall my fall from grace
Oh yeah
Another time another place
Lady writer on the TV
She knew all about a history
You couldnt hardly write your name
I think I want you just the same as the
Lady writer on the TV
