[Intro: Sting]
I want my
I want my MTV
I want my
I want my MTV
I want my
I want my MTV
I want my
I want my MTV

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Mark Knopfler]
Now look at them yo-yo's, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and chicks for free
Now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

[Chorus: Mark Knopfler and Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TV's

[Verse 2: Knopfler]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire

[Chorus: Knopfler and Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TV's

[Ad Lib: Knopfler]
Mover, mover

[Chorus: Sting and Knopfler]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TV's

[Ad Lib: Knopfler]
Looky here, look out

[Verse 3: Knopfler and Sting]
I shoulda learned to play the guitar
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera, man
We could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
Bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin', get your chicks for free

[Chorus: Knopfler and Sting]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TV's

[Outro: Knopfler and Sting]
Listen here, now that ain't workin' that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin', and your chicks for free
Money for nothin',  and chicks for free

Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin' (money for nothing)
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free
Money for nothin'
And your chicks for free

Look at that, look at that

Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And your chicks for free (I want my MTV)

Easy easy money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Easy easy chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Easy easy money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)

That ain't workin'

Money for nothing
Chicks for free
Money for nothing
Chicks for free
