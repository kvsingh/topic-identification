You get a shiver in the dark
Its raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear that music ring
Well now you step inside
But you dont see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns they blowin that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south London town
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind its strictly rhythm
He doesnt want to make it cry or sing
Lefthanded old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
And Harry doesnt mind if he doesnt make the scene
Hes got a daytime job – Hes doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing
And a crowd of young boys
Theyre fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They dont give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It aint what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah the Sultans they play Creole
Creole
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
Goodnight now its time to go home
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing
