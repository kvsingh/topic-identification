Getting crazy on the waltzers but its the life that I choose
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo
And Ive been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam
And I dont know where Ill be tonight but Id always tell you where I am
In a screaming ring of faces Ive seen her standing in the light
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above
And Im just high on the world
Come on and take a low ride with me girl
On the tunnel of love
Its just the danger when youre riding at your own risk
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby lets keep it like this
Its just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play
Well its been money for muscle another whirligig
Money for muscle and another girl I dig
Another hustle just to make it big
And rockaway rockaway
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did
Like the Spanish City to me when we were kids
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me stay
And now Im searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades
In any shooting gallery where promises are made
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway
