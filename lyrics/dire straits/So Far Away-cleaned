Here I am again in this mean old town
And youre so far away from me
And where are you when the sun goes down
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far I just cant see
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me alright
Im tired of being in love and being all alone
When youre so far away from me
Im tired of making out on the telephone
Cause youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far I just cant see
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me alright
And I get so tired when I have to explain
Then youre so far away from me
See youve been in the sun and Ive been in the rain
And youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far I just cant see
Youre so far away from me
Youre so far away from me take it down
so far away
Youre so far away from me
Alright
I m so far away from you
