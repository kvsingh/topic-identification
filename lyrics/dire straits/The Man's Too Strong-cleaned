I am just an aging drummer boy
And in the wars I used to play
And Ive called a tune
To many a torture session
Now they say I am a war criminal
And Im fading away
Father please hear my confession
I have legalized robbery
Called it  belief
I have arun with the money
And hid like a thief
Rewritten history
With my armies and my crooks
Invented memories
I did burn all the books
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The mans too big
The mans too strong
Well Ive tried to be meek
And Ive tried to be mild
But I spat like a woman
And I sulked like a child
I have lived behind walls
That have made me alone
Striven for peace
Which I never have known
And I can still hear his laughter
And I can still hear his song
The mans too big
The mans too strong
Well the sun rose on the courtyard
And they all did hear him say
You always was a Judas
But I got you anyway
You may have got your silver
But I swear upon my life
Your sister gave me diamonds
And I gave them to your wife
Oh father please help me
For I have done wrong
The mans too big
The mans too strong
