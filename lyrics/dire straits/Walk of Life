[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Got a Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 2]
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
He do the walk, he do the walk of life

[Verse 1]
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Yeah, the boy can play
Dedication devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

[Outro]
And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, you do the walk of life
