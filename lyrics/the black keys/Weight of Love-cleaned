I used to think darlin you never did nothin
But you were always up to somethin
Always had a run in yeah
I got to think those days are comin to get ya
Now no body want to protect yah
They only want to forget yah
Youll be on my mind
Dont give yourself away
To the weight of love
Youll be on your side
Dont give yourself away
The weight of weight of love
Dance all night cause people they dont wanna be lonely
Never wanna be lonely
They dont wanna be an only  one
You had a thing no one could ever be sure of
Never ever had a pure love
And never no cure from
Youll be on my mind
Dont give yourself away
To the weight of love
Youll be on your side
Dont give yourself away
The weight of weight of love
