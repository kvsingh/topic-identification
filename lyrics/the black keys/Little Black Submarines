[Verse 1]
Little black submarines, operator please
Put me back on the line
Told my girl I'd be back, operator please
This is wreckin' my mind

[Hook]
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 2]
Pick you up, let you down when I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me, I had plans, but they just disappeared
To the back of my mind

[Hook]
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind

[Verse 3]
Treasure maps, fallen trees, operator please
Call me back when it's time
Stolen friends and disease, operator please
Pass me back to my mind

[Hook]
Oh can it be? The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I should've seen it glow, but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
