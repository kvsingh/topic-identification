Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can’t take much more
I could never drown in
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
Its all right aint no guarding my high
Clouds covered loves
Barbwired snare
Strung up strung out
I just can’t go without
I could never drown in
They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain’t blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
Its all right aint no guarding my high
