I could take the pitchfork from the Devil
Keep a supersuit like Im Incredible
From the deep blue sea to the dark blue sky
Im the baddest man alive
Ill grab a crocodile by its tail
Handcuff the judge and throw the cops in jail
Make the meanest woman breakdown and cry
Im the baddest man alive
Im the baddest man alive
Ill take no mess and Ill take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
Im the baddest man alive
Im the baddest man alive
Not bad meaning bad but Im bad meaning good
Say my name three times and you knock on wood
Candy man hooks I terrorize your hood
Flashing Macs on a cop the way a gangsta should
I snatch food from the mouth of a tiger
Take a gasoline bath then I walk through fire
Bearhug a grizzly suck milk from her titty
Take the Sergeants hat from his head and use it as a frisbee
Spit in the crocodile face
Have a ménage à trois with two female apes
Then sleep in the barrel of butcher knives
I drank honey straight from the beehive
Bungee jumping off the Empire State butt naked
Roller blade across the Golden Gate butt naked
With the baddest man alive and I dont plan to die
When the Grim Reaper come Ill look him right in his eye
Ill bust in the face of the witch of the east
Tell a great white shark to go and brush his teeth 
Im the man who stole the golden fleece
And I dateraped beauty right in front of the beast
The baddest man alive and I dont plan to die
Im the baddest man alive
Ill take no mess and Ill take no jive
Sometimes I feel like I can fly
Im the baddest man alive
Im the baddest man alive
