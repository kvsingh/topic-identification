When I hear them use your name
I get all choked up inside
Its not only from the shame
Its like 10 different lovers died
Except youre still just a mile away
But theres nothing left to say
Dont leave us not in love again
Cause we might break instead of bend
I felt a little stain in the pouring rain
It washed away almost everything
If I found another love
They must be forever true
Cause if someone breaks this heart
Your old man right here is through
Heaven just seems so far away
When theres nothing left to say
Dont leave us not in love again
The little girl cant comprehend
She had another dream that her mamas gone
Shes alright but youre all wrong
