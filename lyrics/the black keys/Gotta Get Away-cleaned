I got paid then I was on the road
In a heartbeat Mama said Mama said
You got a one track mind but you aint gonna get it all the time
She wasnt lyin
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hopin I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
My last dime got used up
On gasoline know what I mean what I mean
Atlanta GA by the end of the day
No other way thats what I say
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hopin I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
And everything I had to say
Wish wed gone so far away
Well now I
Cant stay
Blacktop I cant stop
For no one its no fun no fun
With a one track mind if you dont get lucky some time
But still Im tryin
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hopin I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
I went from San Berdoo to Kalamazoo
Just to get away from you
I searched far and wide hopin I was wrong
But maybe all the good women are gone
