Well Im so above you it is plain to see
But I came to love you anyway
So you pulled my heart out
And I dont mind bleeding
Any old time you keep me waiting waiting waiting
Oh oh oh oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Im a lonely boy
Well your mama kept you but your daddy left you
And I should have done you just the same
But I came to love you
Am I born to bleed
Any old time you keep me waiting waiting waiting
Oh oh oh oh I got a love that keeps me waiting
Im a lonely boy
