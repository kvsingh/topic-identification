I wanted love I needed love
Most of all most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And Im bound to fall bound to fall for you
Oh what can I do Yeah
Take my badge but my heart remains
Lovin you baby child
Tighten up on your reins
You are runnin wild runnin wild its true
Sick for days in so many ways
Im achin now Im achin now
Its times like these I need relief
Please show me how oh show me how to get right
Yeah its out of sight
When I was young and movin fast
Nothin slowed me down oh slowed me down
Now I let the others pass Ive come around
Oh come around cause Ive found
Livin just to keep goin
Goin just to be sane
All the while not knowin
Its such a shame
I dont need to get steady
I know just how I feel
Im tellin you to be ready
My dear
