Fever whered you run to
Fever whered you run to
Acting right is so routine
Fever let me live a dream
Fever Im a slave to
No one misbehave too
Fever that misunderstood
Wouldnt leave you if I could
Fever
Fever cause Im breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever why dont you explain
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever why dont you explain
Break it down again
Fever can you hear me
Fever can you hear me
You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to live again
It used to be a blessing
But fevers got me stressing
Realize I am to blame
But fever let me play the game
Fever
Fever cause Im breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever why dont you explain
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever why dont you explain
Break it down again
Now if the cold pale light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Now if the cold pale light in your eyes
Reaches those horizon lines
You know not to leave her
Fever
