Little black submarines operator please
Put me back on the line
Told my girl Id be back operator please
This is wreckin my mind
Oh can it be The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I shouldve seen it glow but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Pick you up let you down when I wanna go
To a place I can hide
You know me I had plans but they just disappeared
To the back of my mind
Oh can it be The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I shouldve seen it glow but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
Treasure maps fallen trees operator please
Call me back when its time
Stolen friends and disease operator please
Pass me back to my mind
Oh can it be The voices calling me
They get lost in and out of time
I shouldve seen it glow but everybody knows
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
That a broken heart is blind
