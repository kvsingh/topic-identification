Built an opera house for you in the deepest jungle
And I walked across its stage singing with my eyes closed
Ive got a love for you I just cant escape
All of my love for you cuts me like barbed wire
Ooh I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight
If I abandoned love Id be a man without dreams 
Id rather be out there staring death right between its eyes now
And I can still hear the sound of you crying through the night
There in the opera house with no one else for miles
Ooh I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight
Ooh I was meant to love you
And always keep you in my life
Ooh I was meant to love you
I knew I loved you at first sight
