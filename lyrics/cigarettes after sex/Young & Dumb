[Verse 1]
Wearing black lipstick, bleaching your hair blonde
Put on your socks
Cut-offs and jean shorts, vampire fangs
And your I Love New York shirt

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

[Chorus]
You want to go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on
I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat, you showed me
I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat, oh, baby

[Verse 2]
My heart is racing watching you kiss him on my guitar
Faking the teardrop by spraying my eye with that water gun

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I know full well that you are
The patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

[Chorus]
We want to go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on
I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat, you showed me
I drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat, oh, baby
