Hes got so much love for her
But he doesnt know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside of school
Hes in for a heartbreak if its all been blind faith
From my point of view
Baby hes got to be crazy
Living like hes John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby hes got to be crazy
Hes got so much in his heart
But he doesnt know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room
Hes always feeling cheated telling all his secrets
That I couldnt keep
Baby hes got to be crazy
Living like hes John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby hes got to be crazy
Baby hes got to be crazy
Living like hes John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby hes got to be crazy
