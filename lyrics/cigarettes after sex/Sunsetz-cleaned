Sun sets we wander through a foreign town
Strangely theres nobody else around
See you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground
And when you go away I still see you
The sunlight on your face in the rear view
Sun sets I want to hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigans book covers
That we both adored
And when you go away I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
When you go away I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rear view
