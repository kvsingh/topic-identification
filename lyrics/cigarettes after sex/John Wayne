[Verse 1]
He's got so much love for her
But he doesn't know what to do
Sitting in the car
Waiting outside of school

[Pre-Chorus]
He's in for a heartbreak if it's all been blind faith
From my point of view

[Chorus]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

[Verse 2]
He's got so much in his heart
But he doesn't know what to do
All he wants is her
Lying inside his room

[Pre-Chorus]
He's always feeling cheated, telling all his secrets
That I couldn't keep

[Chorus]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy

[Outro]
Baby, he's got to be crazy
Living like he's John Wayne
Always facing the world and chasing the girl
Baby, he's got to be crazy
