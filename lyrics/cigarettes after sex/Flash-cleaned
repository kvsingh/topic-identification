Im a flash you were blinded by the love I had
Im a flash the light could only get in through the cracks
And youve got to do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
When they crash the helicopters in my heart are red
Cut in half you saw me lying there bleeding to death
And you had to do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
Now I stand on the stage I forget my lines
Do you play Satans imagination
And a voice in my heads causing suicide
Searching for any way to remember them
And youve got to do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
Do the right thing do the right thing baby
Youre the white swan in the photograph
