I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back
We were sitting down in a restaurant waiting for the check
We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached
But I could tell that something had changed how you looked at me then
Kristen come right back
Ive been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle
And on the Lower East Side youre dancing with me now
And Im taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall
Think I like you best when youre dressed in black from head to toe
Think I like you best when youre just with me
And no one else
Kristen come right back
Ive been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle
And Im kissing you lying in my room
Holding you until you fall asleep
And its just as good as I knew it would be
Stay with me I dont want you to leave
Kristen come right back
Ive been waiting for you to slip back in bed
When you light the candle
