I feel like I may have been here before
All of it looks so familiar
I wanna see beyond the obvious
So show me a new constellation
Ay
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Ay
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Whoa Whoa Whoa
I feel like I’m always the last to know
The king of the dunces and the idiots
But where is the bliss in all this ignorance
Oh just show me a new constellation
Ay
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Ay
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Never again never again never again
Don’t you get it
I only want to break your spell
Ohh oh ohhh
Don’t you get it
You’re the snake that eats its tail
Hey
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Hey
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again
Ay
Whoa Whoa Whoa
He he he why man
Heheheh aw
