You are stellar
Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
Ive grown tired of that place
Wont you come with me
We could start again
How do you do it
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it
Its better than I ever knew
Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If youre afraid of heights
I need you to see this place
It might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you
How do you do it
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it
Its better than I ever knew
You are stellar
How do you do it
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it
Its better than I ever knew
How do you do it
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it
Make me feel like I do
