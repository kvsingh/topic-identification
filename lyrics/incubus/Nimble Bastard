[Verse 1]
Has it come to this?
We're stuck in the weeds
I get it, I'm not perfect
I was never trying to be
But I'm not long for this earth
If we really only ever get one chance to burn
I gotta trip before I can see the finish
How else would I learn?
I wanna know, how is it you do it?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Verse 2]
I swing and I miss
And then come the creeps
It makes me want to faint
I wanna know, how is it you do it?
How do you spill the paint?
And then fit it into a frame?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Break]

[Bridge]
Has it come to this?
Has it come to this?

[Chorus]
When you land on your feet
You're a nimble bastard
And you don't skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Look out
Won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down?

[Chorus]
You're a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
You're a nimble bastard
Yeah, won't you show, lowly us
How do you see the stars?
