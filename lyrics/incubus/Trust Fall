It's only a trust fall
It's only a trust fall

[Verse 1]
Things have been a little inside out, apologies
Babe, I'm gonna ride out the tide, take it in stride
Where would I run to?
Even if I was in disguise, it'll follow me
It's funny how the little things stick, make you seasick
Sweep you off your feet!
Sweep me off my feet!

[Chorus]
It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe

[Verse 2]
I like it when you look at me like I'm an alien
Lure me with a lock of your hair
Taking that dare is a fire under my feet
Now I see I gotta let go if I wanna know
Gotta let it steal my face
Now I embrace
What's in front of me!
Right in front of me!

[Chorus]
It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse
Lets you sail across the known universe

Everyone's in on it
And only a fool would quit
Love is the last and first!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Love is the last and first
Lets you sail across the known universe
It's only a trust fall
(aaaaaah)

It's only a trust fall
Into the arms of all
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Everyone's in on it
And only a fool would quit
Love is the last and first!
Lets you sail across the known universe
Love is a blessed curse!
Lets you sail across the known universe

It's only a trust fall
(aaaaaah)

[Verse 3]
The palms of your feet
The whites of your eyes
The marrow in the tree
The sap in your bones
Same as the pistol, heavy in hand
Same as the storms, spinning on Io
Not a divide
That's an illusion, a collective dream
You startle and wake
Salute the abyss
Smile and surrender
Into a glimpse
The rapturous nothing
Into the arms of your captor
Into the arms of the all
Into the arms of the all
Into the arms  (of the all)
Of he all
