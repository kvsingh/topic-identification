[Verse 1]
Could there be another universe?
One that wasn't always out to getcha?
Man, it breaks my heart a little bit
That you're like a sleepwalker
Half alive and hanging by a thread

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet, no
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Maybe there's a poem in reverse
Spoken and it holds me out forever
Man, it breaks my heart a little bit, oh
That love is like a blind archer
Tryin' to shoot an apple off my head

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet
Not yet

[Bridge]
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
Not dead yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken
No they ain't seen nothing yet
We're undefeated, bent but not broken

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet
I'm not dead yet, no
I'm bent but not broken
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm not dead yet (ooh)
I'm bent but not broken (ooh)
And I'm not dead yet (ooh)
No
