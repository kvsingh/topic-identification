Could there be another universe
One that wasnt always out to getcha
Man it breaks my heart a little bit
That youre like a sleepwalker
Half alive and hanging by a thread
Im not dead yet
Im not dead yet no
Im bent but not broken
And Im not dead yet no
Yeah
Maybe theres a poem in reverse
Spoken and it holds me out forever
Man it breaks my heart a little bit oh
That love is like a blind archer
Tryin to shoot an apple off my head
Im not dead yet
Im not dead yet no
Im bent but not broken
And Im not dead yet
Not yet
Were undefeated bent but not broken
No they aint seen nothing yet
Were undefeated bent but not broken
Not dead yet
Were undefeated bent but not broken
No they aint seen nothing yet
Were undefeated bent but not broken
Im not dead yet
Im not dead yet no
Im bent but not broken
And Im not dead yet 
Im not dead yet 
Im not dead yet 
Im bent but not broken 
And Im not dead yet 
No
