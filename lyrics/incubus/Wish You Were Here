[Verse 1]
I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind
Pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy - happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs
I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

[Verse 3]
The world's a roller coaster
And I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care
But my hands are busy in the air saying

[Chorus]
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
