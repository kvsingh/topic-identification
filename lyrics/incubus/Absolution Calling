[Verse 1]
It’s like an intuition, or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression that’s always everywhere
You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
(Into that spot, where we untie every knot)
Spinning past the ceiling, absolution calling
“Are you there, or not?”

[Verse 2]
It’s an open invitation, come see the sights of sages
We’ve been a pride of lions, so afraid to leave our cages
Don’t fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]X2

You bit into the apple, laid down your sword and shield
(Untie! A little bit dies, a little each time, the medicine smiles)
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
(Inside, your elegant guide, an arrow in flight, a million miles)

[Chorus]X2
