[Intro]
You are stellar

[Verse 1]
Meet me in outer space
We could spend the night
Watch the earth come up
I've grown tired of that place
Won't you come with me?
We could start again

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

[Verse 2]
Meet me in outer space
I will hold you close
If you're afraid of heights
I need you to see this place
It might be the only way
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

[Bridge]
You are stellar

[Chorus]
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
It's better than I ever knew

How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
How do you do it?
Make me feel like I do
