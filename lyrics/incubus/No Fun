[Verse 1]
I feel like I may have been here before
All of it looks so familiar
I wanna see beyond the obvious
So show me a new constellation

[Chorus]
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[Verse 2]
I feel like I’m always the last to know
The king of the dunces and the idiots
But where is the bliss in all this ignorance?
Oh just show me a new constellation

[Chorus]
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Ay!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

[Bridge]
Never again, never again, never again
Don’t you get it?
I only want to break your spell
Ohh oh ohhh
Don’t you get it?
You’re the snake that eats its tail

[Chorus]
Hey!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!
Hey!
You’re no fun
You’re no fun
You’re a song I never wanna hear again!

[Outro]
Ay!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
He he he why man?
Heheheh... aw
