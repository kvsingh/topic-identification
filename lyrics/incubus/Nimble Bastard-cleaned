Has it come to this
Were stuck in the weeds
I get it Im not perfect
I was never trying to be
But Im not long for this earth
If we really only ever get one chance to burn
I gotta trip before I can see the finish
How else would I learn
I wanna know how is it you do it
When you land on your feet
Youre a nimble bastard
And you dont skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Youre a nimble bastard
Wont you show lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down
I swing and I miss
And then come the creeps
It makes me want to faint
I wanna know how is it you do it
How do you spill the paint
And then fit it into a frame
When you land on your feet
Youre a nimble bastard
And you dont skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Youre a nimble bastard
Yeah wont you show lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down
Has it come to this
Has it come to this
When you land on your feet
Youre a nimble bastard
And you dont skip a beat
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Look out
Wont you show lowly us
How do you see the stars from that far down
Youre a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Such a nimble bastard
Salt of the earth
Youre a nimble bastard
Yeah wont you show lowly us
How do you see the stars
