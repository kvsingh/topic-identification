Pardon me while I burst
Pardon me while I burst
A decade ago
I never thought I would be
At twentythree
On the verge of spontaneous combustion
Woe is me
But I guess that it comes with the territory
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity
I need you to hear
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me
So pardon me while I burst into flames
Ive had enough of the world and its peoples mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me pardon me Ill never be the same
Now two days ago
I was having a look in a book
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee
I said I can relate
Because lately Ive been thinking of combustication
As a welcomed vacation
From the burdens of the planet earth
Like gravity hypocrisy and the perils of being in 3D
But thinking so much differently
So pardon me while I burst into flames
Ive had enough of the world and its peoples mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me pardon me Ill never be the same
Never be the same yeah
Pardon me while I burst into flames
Pardon me pardon me pardon me
So pardon me while I burst into flames
Ive had enough of the world and its peoples mindless games
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame
Pardon me pardon me Ill never be the same
Pardon me never be the same yeah
