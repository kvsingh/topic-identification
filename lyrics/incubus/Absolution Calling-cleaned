It’s like an intuition or a feeling in the air
An intangible impression that’s always everywhere
You bit into the apple laid down your sword and shield
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field
I remember feeling the opposite of falling
Spinning past the ceiling absolution calling
“Are you there or not”
It’s an open invitation come see the sights of sages
We’ve been a pride of lions so afraid to leave our cages
Don’t fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one
