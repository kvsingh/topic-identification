Time in constant motion
Like the shifting desert sands
Slipping through my hands

Chasing down the minutes
That turn into days
Seconds get shorter
As years fall away

Chasing down my dreams
Under borrowed light
A mirage in the distance
Escaping my sight

Driven to live or driven apart
What's inside us when we depart
Driven to live outside of regret
Time is finite, the clocks are set
Driven to live or driven apart
Driven to live or driven apart

I realize my flame is burning away
Starward searching I will find my way
The power of the mind ready to combust
I will show you fear in a handful of dust
I will show you fear in a handful of dust

Combust

My flame is fleeting
But I will live and learn
Rise and burn, Tick and Turn
Rise and burn

Time in constant motion
Like the shifting desert sands
Slipping through my hands

Driven to live or driven apart
What's inside us when we depart
Driven to live outside of regret
Time is finite, the clocks are set
Driven to live or driven apart
Driven to live or driven apart
Combust
