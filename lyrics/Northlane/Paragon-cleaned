The last of our martyrs seeks no adoration
From his castle in the air of eternal vibration
We won’t lose sight of the lasting words he wrote
We won’t lose sight of what matters most
A shining beacon of wisdom
Armed to the teeth
Fearless conviction
Now that he’s gone we’re going to miss him
Immortalised between the lines
Conceived by a human heart inside
He once said to us my friend hope is a prison
But the hope his chords sung only spread love
In a hollow crowned kingdom
There are no fighters left here anymore
See you on the other side
Of that open door
We wont lose sight
We wont lose sight
Of the lasting words he wrote
We won’t lose sight of what matters most
