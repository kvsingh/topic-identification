Waves of poverty of hope and desperation
Waves of tragedy of death and desolation
Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind cant you see youre fucking blind
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind
Stranger so far from home
Theres a terror in your eyes
You whisper words of a hell unknown
Stranger in a sea unclear
The currents that drifted us now draw us near
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Whos gonna save them
Running from war to woe theres nowhere to go
Neighbour will you take my hand
Is there still virtue in your heart
That will shelter me from dark
Have you stopped to think and reflect that in this lifetime
Your child could be next
All we show is neglect
Why do we disconnect the hearts
From the lives that fell apart
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Whos gonna save them
Running from war to wor theres nowhere to go
Mayhem
Mayhem
Running from war to wor theres nowhere to go
Save them
Save them
Running from war to wor theres nowhere to go
Borders built to barricade
No one enters no one is saved
Borders built to barricade
Building walls
Digging graves
The rivers rise with the lives of dead men
Open up the gates
Welcome to mayhem
Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind
Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe theres nowhere to go
Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe theres nowhere to go
Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Whos gonna save them
Running from war to woe theres nowhere to go
Mayhem
Mayhem
Running from war to wor theres nowhere to go
Save them
Save them
Running from war to wor theres nowhere to go
