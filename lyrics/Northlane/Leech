Follow me underwater
Until the searchlights leave the shore
Follow me underwater
Until we find what we're looking for

[Chorus]
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm

They found the pipeline through the soul in the soil
I thought this place never changed
But now the reefs are bleeding smells of oil
And the forests are up in flames

You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned

Give me a reason, tell me why we lost our reason
Tell me the truth, not an excuse
Cause we have everything to lose

[Chorus]
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm

There's a cancer in our lifeblood, so silently it grew
The streams of least resistance poison me and poison you
There’s a virus in the air, that drags the wind out from my chest
I don’t see a way out
All I see is a sphere of unrest

Show me a way out
Show me a way out
Show me a way out

Follow me underwater
Until the searchlights leave the shore
Follow me underwater
Until we find what we're looking for

[Chorus]
Plastic oceans, plastic farms
Cover your footprints like a band-aid on a broken arm

You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
You fell asleep, you fell asleep, you fell asleep
While your bed burned
