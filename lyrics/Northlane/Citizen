[Intro]
Save us

[Verse 1]
If you thought you knew it all
Don’t shift your view, you might slip and fall
A long way down and down this rabbit hole
If the tunnel runs any deeper
You might come out the other side of the world
Maybe upside down you’ll be able see this isn’t what it seems
We are far from free

[Chorus]
We’re caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper into the unknown
We’re caught in the undertow
Follow the leader down with the undertow

[Verse 2]
Action floats in limbo like driftwood in the sea
Under CCTV, so dig down deep
The more you uncover, the more you disbelieve
The more you will discover
We are far from free

Heroes exposing corruption in who we obey
Blow the whistle from a burning stake
The whistle blows from a burning stake
Corruption won’t keep revolution at bay

[Chorus]
We’re caught in the undertow
Deeper and deeper into the unknown
We’re caught in the undertow
Follow the leader down with the undertow

Spied on, lifelong, collection 24/7
Archives of all we’ve done
Satellites track our lives beyond the skies
Not even your mind can hide from big brother’s eyes

It’s time to take back our home
Thank you Mr. Snow
