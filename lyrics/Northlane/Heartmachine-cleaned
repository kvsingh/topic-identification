I’m breathing just to pass the time
I forgot to eat tonight
Just running down the clock today
With hope the ache will go away
Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I’m paralyzed with pain
We suffer in a heartmachine
Unstable feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer
Hope is strange sometimes it leads you on
There’s no exception when you’re halfway gone
A second chance flash of light that brought me to my knees
A burning vision etched in memories
Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I’m paralyzed with pain
We suffer in a heartmachine
Unstable feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine
Time heals the wounds it builds up strength inside
Facing the truth there’s nothing left to hide
We suffer
Unstable
Pins and needles
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine
