I am what I create

Lashed by tongues of electric fire
Shimmering rivers crystalline
Run though frozen glimpses in time
And I just can't ignore this sight
Pouring down on me relentlessly
I just can't ignore this feeling
Deafened by rolling waves of realisation
Frozen, mesmerised in the rain

[Chorus]
In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour

Droplets of life form in freefall in convalescence
They hammer into the soil
Carving new streams of essence, through turmoil

I am just as fluid, as immortal and lucid
As the Earth that morphs, in the violence of a thunderstorm

My life is what I make of my trials and mistakes
My life is what I make, I am what I create

I am what I create
I am what I create
I am what I create

[Chorus]
In my darkest days
I only saw the shades of grey
In a world that drips in colour
