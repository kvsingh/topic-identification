Comatose in the arms of Morpheus
Drifting away to a place
Where there’s more than this

Blindfolded visionary, eyes lost in the black and bleak
Chasing footsteps in the dark, lost for where they’ll lead
Idols and stars shower light on the sublime
Blinding your mind’s eye
Bright as your dreams shine

Blinding your mind’s eye
Reclaim your life
Reclaim your life
From the iron grip of social design

Reclaim your life
Your cycle around the sun is eclipsing

Like most of us I was misled into a swarm of noise and distortion
Eroding my deepest thoughts before my inner voice had spoken
To remind me I’m gifted with the power to dream
To see what has never been seen
But I handed it over, consumed by culture
Cloaking the eyes of the visionary

Comatose in the arms of Morpheus
Drifting away to a place
Where there’s more than this
Hypnosis
