I am the tear in the gravity
The universal truth is my reality
In a drifting space
Where the dark draws near
I am stronger than fear
Collapse under the horizon
The ruins of a thousand stars
Illuminate who we are
No drive
No direction
Purify
My perception
Sail on
Through the rift between the sky and ocean
Sail on
Find the peace that keeps your world in motion
Stare into the face of the sun
It melts away a shell of wax
To show the world how fucked Ive become
No drive
No direction
Purify my perception
Theres a desert in my head
But an oasis in my dreams
Where veins glow in leaves
And illuminate the breeze
I will drag my being
To the edge of the beginning
Never still never idle
Sever me from the endless spiral
Sail on
Through the rift between the sky and ocean
Sail on
Find the peace that keeps your world in motion
Lost inside a drifting space
Where drifting days interlace
And everything I saw so clear
Dances then disappears
I need to be grounded
But the plates keep shifting
So I look for my place
Where this space stops drifting
