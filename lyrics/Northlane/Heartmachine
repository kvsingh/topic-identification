[Verse 1]
I’m breathing just to pass the time
I forgot to eat tonight
Just running down the clock today
With hope the ache will go away

[Pre-Chorus]
Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I’m paralyzed with pain

[Chorus]
We suffer in a heartmachine
Unstable, feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer

[Verse 2]
Hope is strange, sometimes it leads you on
There’s no exception when you’re halfway gone
A second chance flash of light that brought me to my knees
A burning vision etched in memories

[Pre-Chorus]
Body starts to shake
Head begins to spin
Leaves me in its wake
I’m paralyzed with pain

[Chorus]
We suffer in a heartmachine
Unstable, feeling everything
Pins and needles stitching up my skin
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine

[Bridge]
Time heals the wounds, it builds up strength inside
Facing the truth, there’s nothing left to hide

[Outro]
We suffer
Unstable
Pins and needles
We suffer trapped in a heartmachine
