[Verse 1]
In an age where stars only draw us in
Gaze is swept from our mother who birthed us here
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon

[Chorus]
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host

[Verse 2]
Silenced by the solar wind
Forests evergreen wither to sand
There’s still shade in this wasteland
Shadows of towering glass span
As far as you can set your sights on
Take a good long look at that horizon

[Chorus]
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host

[Bridge]
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
She’s stormy, doubted and over-relied on
Take a good long look at that horizon

Open your eyes
Two worlds collide
Open your eyes

[Chorus]
We bleed it dry
We multiply
And soon we’ll say it’s time to fly
So scorch the host

Watch it die
