Waves of poverty, of hope and desperation
Waves of tragedy, of death and desolation
Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind can't you see you're fucking blind
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind

Stranger, so far from home
There's a terror in your eyes
You whisper words of a hell unknown
Stranger in a sea unclear
The currents that drifted us now draw us near

Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Who's gonna save them?
Running from war to woe there's nowhere to go

Neighbour will you take my hand?
Is there still virtue in your heart
That will shelter me from dark?
Have you stopped to think and reflect that in this lifetime
Your child could be next?
All we show is neglect
Why do we disconnect the hearts
From the lives that fell apart?

Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Who's gonna save them?
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go

Mayhem
Mayhem
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
Save them
Save them
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go

Borders built to barricade
No one enters, no one is saved
Borders built to barricade
Building walls
Digging graves
The rivers rise with the lives of dead men
Open up the gates
Welcome to mayhem

Waves of fugitives forced to flee their broken homes
Hostile humankind thinking with a narrow mind

Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe there's nowhere to go
Farewell to the world they know
From war to woe there's nowhere to go

Welcome to mayhem
Farewell to the world they know
Who's gonna save them?
Running from war to woe there's nowhere to go

Mayhem
Mayhem
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
Save them
Save them
Running from war to wor there's nowhere to go
