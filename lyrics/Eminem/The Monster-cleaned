Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew see but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to dos be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh Hit the lottery oohwee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think Im gettin so huge I need a shrink
Im beginnin to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
Going coocoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But Im actually weirder than you think ‘cause Im—
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well that’s nothin
Well that’s nothin
Now I aint much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And dont squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjurin
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah ponderin will do you wonders
No wonder youre losing your mind the way it wanders
Yodelodelayheehoo
I think it went wanderin off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I loves killing me
And I cant conquer it
My OCD is conkin me in the head keep knockin
Nobodys home Im sleepwalkin
Im just relayin what the voice in my heads sayin
Dont shoot the messenger Im just friends with the—
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well that’s nothin
Well that’s nothin
Call me crazy but I have this vision
One day that Ill walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and
Im comin straight at MCs blood gets spilled and
Ill take it back to the days that Id get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I aint here to save the fuckin children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it
And relates thats great its payback Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothin into somethin still can
Make that straw into gold chump I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts
I am nuts for real but Im okay with that
Its nothin Im still friends with the—
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Im friends with the monster thats under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
Youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
And you think Im crazy yeah you think Im crazy
Well that’s nothin
Well that’s nothin
