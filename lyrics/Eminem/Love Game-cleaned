Somethings burning I cant figure out what 
Its either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded must
Just be the powder from the power of 
But Im in something I dont know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soontobespouse’s moan
And the further I walk the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain thats what I heard
‘Cause after all this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her bust her
The thoughts scary yo though and it hurts – brace
Hope it aint Here we go yo
‘Cause my head already goes to worstcase
Scenario though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Shoulda known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No  you dont  under  stand
I  dont  do this for anyone ever
Yeah that aint what they all say
Ill say you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
Til you sucked on Wayne André and Kanye
LeBron Akon Jay Lil Jon Raekwon Mae
Polow Tha Don Dre Dante Ross James Conway Kwame
Guess Im gettin my ggoddang Jigga on eh
‘Cause your name Im beyond sayin
But fuck it Im movin on you women are all cray
But Ill probably always keep on playin—
The game of love love love love
Lalalalala love
She doesnt love me no she dont love me no more
She hates my company yeah she dont love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do – I dont care
And I told her Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do – I dont care
I told that bitch Im a sucker for love you a sucker for dick
Suckin dick in your momma tub then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick dont forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels you little fuckin Ferris Wheel
Fuckin spinnin on me – fuck you think we gon get married still
Fuckin Mary had a little lamb this aint no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin feel
Like you should fuckin beat it
Or fuckin eat it while Im on my period
Now have a blessed day Bitch you serious
Im in the mirror with this look on my face curious
Why you aint fuckin with me you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin Im delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
Thats analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin cordial yeah I got some home trainin
That aint what you like aint it
What about if I was as famous as Marshall
Would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing I hope shes good enough
Meanwhile youre chasin her
Chlamydia couldnt even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me Ima live with the—
The game of love love love love
Lalalalala love
She doesnt love me no she dont love me no more
She hates my company yeah she dont love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do – I dont care
And I told her Go where you wanna go
Go do whatcha want to do – I dont care
So needless to say Im feelin betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off WeeBey from The Wires dick
Now shes chasin me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
Its all my fault anyway shes turning the tables Im a beatbreak
She treats my face like Serato she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her bday
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding but just as I went to slam on the brakes
Thats when I realized that she may be as crazy as me wait
Bitch cut my fuckin brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin 73 thank God theres an exit comin up
What the mother FUCKs wrong with her
Hit the off ramp til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fuckin tree now here she comes at full speed
Shes racing at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it then pay to have the street repaved
 Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though ‘cause shes laying next to me in bed – directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up
Like Fuck it Ive had it Im checkin into rehab
I confess Im a static addict I guess thats why Im so clingy
Every girl Ive ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or Im too fuckin dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter Im just a fuckin romantic
I fuckin love you you fuckin bitch
Combative possessive in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said Hit the road and after she left
I sent that bitch a text I said Be careful driving
Dont read this and have an accident
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in LOreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling Rape
Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless youre Andrea Yates dont ask me for a date
Dont be late well the sentiments great
But wait think theres been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
Its mainly because of the game of— 
Wait dinner at eight I have infinite hate in my blood
Its mainly because of the game of—
Love love love love
Ll llllove
