Now this shits about to kick off this party looks wack
Lets take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
Im bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
Thats why my pen needs a pad ‘cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction Im bout to kick it
Like a magician critics I turn to crickets
Got em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell em Stick it
So sick Im looking pale wait thats my pigment
Bout to go ham ya bish shout out to Kendrick
Lets bring it back to that vintage Slim bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I dont mean Stimpys friend bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym bitch
Kick your shoes off let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out
 all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause its mayhem til the AM
So baby make just like KFed
And let yourself go let yourself go
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk grab your vial yeah
Guess its just the way that Im dressed aint it
Khakis pressed Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it aint that aftershave
Or cologne that made em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game check mate
But girl your bodys bangin jump me in dang bangbang
Yes siree Bob I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kids rock baw with da baw dangdang
Powppppow chica pow chica wowwow
Got your gal blowin up a valve valvevalve
Aint slowin down throw in the towel toweltowel
Dumb it down I dont know how huhhuh howhow
At least I know that I dont know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so now ho…
Kick your shoes off let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out
 all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause its mayhem til the AM
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go let yourself go
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk get your vinyls
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian Lamar oh
Sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I aint got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you alone car note
Oh Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth get the bar of soap lathered
Kangols and Carheartless Cargos
Girl youre fixin to get your heart broke
Dont be absurd maam you birdbrain baby
I aint called anybody baby since Birdman unless youre a swallow
Word Rick word man you heard
But dont get discouraged girl
This is your jam unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off let your hair down
 all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out
 all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
‘Cause its mayhem til the AM
So baby make just like KFed
And let yourself go let yourself go
Say Fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berserk grab your vial yeah
