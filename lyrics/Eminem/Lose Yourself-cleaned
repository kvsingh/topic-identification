Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment would you capture it or just let it slip
Yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already Moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how Everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over—blaow
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity oh
There goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont
Give up that easy no he wont have it he knows
His whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
His souls escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms
Close to postmortem it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter he blows its all over
These hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows
Hes known as the Globetrotter lonely roads
God only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose ‘cause here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera
Is told it unfolds I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebodys paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nineto
Five and I cant provide the right type of
Life for my family ‘cause man these goddamn
Food stamps dont buy diapers and theres no movie
Theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotonys gotten me to the point
Im like a snail Ive got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin option—failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better…
You can do anything you set your mind to man
