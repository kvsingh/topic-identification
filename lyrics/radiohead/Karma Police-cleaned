Karma police
Arrest this man he talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge hes like a detuned radio
Karma police
Arrest this girl her Hitler hairdo
Is making me feel ill and we have crashed her party
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
Karma police
Ive given all I can its not enough
Ive given all I can but were still on the payroll
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
Phew for a minute there
I lost myself I lost myself
