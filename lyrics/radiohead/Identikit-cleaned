A moon shaped pool
Dancing clothes wont let me in
And now I know its never gonna be oh me
The sweetfaced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love that we all can love that we all can
Sweetfaced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love that we all can love that we all can
But now I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know I don’t want to know I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know I don’t want to know I don’t want to know
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
Broken hearts make it rain broken hearts make it rain
The pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create that we can create that we can
Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That we can create that we can create
But when I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know I don’t want to know I don’t want
When I see you messing me around
I don’t want to know I don’t want to know I don’t want to know
