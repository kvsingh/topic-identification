Please could you stop the noise Im trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
Whats that
Whats that
When I am king you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
Whats that
Whats that
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking squealing Gucci little piggy
You dont remember
You dont remember
Why dont you remember my name
Off with his head man
Off with his head man
Why dont you remember my name
I guess he does
Rain down rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height height
Rain down rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height height
Thats it sir youre leaving 
The crackle of pigskin 
The dust and the screaming 
The yuppies networking 
The panic the vomit 
The panic the vomit 
God loves his children
God loves his children yeah
