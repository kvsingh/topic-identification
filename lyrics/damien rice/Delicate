[Verse 1]
We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody's watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody's there
It's not that we're scared
It's just that it's delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?

[Verse 2]
We might live like never before
When there's nothing to give
Well, how can we ask for more?
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

[Chorus]
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
So why'd you fill my sorrow
With the words you've borrowed
From the only place you've known?
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you?
Why'd you sing with me at all?
