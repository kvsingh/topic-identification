We might kiss when we are alone
When nobodys watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobodys there
Its not that were scared
Its just that its delicate
So whyd you fill my sorrow
With the words youve borrowed
From the only place youve known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Whyd you sing with me at all
We might live like never before
When theres nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate
So whyd you fill my sorrow
With the words youve borrowed
From the only place youve known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Whyd you sing with me at all
So whyd you fill my sorrow
With the words youve borrowed
From the only place youve known
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to you
Whyd you sing with me at all
