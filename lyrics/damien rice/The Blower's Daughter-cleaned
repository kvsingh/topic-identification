And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time
And so it is
The shorter story
No love no glory
No hero in her skies
I cant take my eyes off of you 
And so it is
Just like you said it should be
Well both forget the breeze
Most of the time
And so it is
The colder water
The blowers daughter
The pupil in denial
I cant take my eyes off of you
I cant take my eyes off of you
I cant take my eyes off of you
I cant take my eyes off of you
I cant take my eyes off of you
I cant take my eyes off of you
Oh did I say
That I loathe you
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind
I cant take my mind off of you
I cant take my mind off of you
I cant take my mind off of you
I cant take my mind off of you
I cant take my mind off of you
I cant take my mind off of you
My mind
My mind
Till I find somebody new
