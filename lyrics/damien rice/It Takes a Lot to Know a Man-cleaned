It takes a lot to know a man
It takes a lot to understand
The warrior the sage
The little boy in rage
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to understand whats humming
The honeybee the stings
The little girl with wings
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to breathe
To touch to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to know a man
A lot to know to understand
The father and the son
The hunter and the gun
It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to comprehend whats coming
The mother and the child
The muse and the beguiled
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to be
To touch to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to be
To touch to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
It takes a lot to live
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with
It takes a lot to be
To touch to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs
What are you so afraid to lose
What is it youre thinking that will happen if you do
What are you so afraid to lose
You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying “this thing is killing me”
What is it youre thinking that will happen if you do
It takes a lot to know a man
What is it youre so afraid so to lose
It takes a lot to know a man
You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying “this thing is killing me”
What is it youre thinking that will happen if you do
It takes a lot to know a man
You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying “this thing is killing me”
What is it you carry on your back
It takes a lot to know a man
What is it you notice when you cant laugh
