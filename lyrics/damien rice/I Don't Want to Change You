[Verse 1]
Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well, I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well, not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing

[Chorus]
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Verse 2]
Wherever you go
Well, I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If it's a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well, I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well, I'm more than willing

[Chorus - x2]
'Cause I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye
And I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a stranger's eye

[Verse 3]
I've never been with anyone
In the way I've been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then it's doomed

[Bridge]
'Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall

[Chorus]
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change you
I don't want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind
