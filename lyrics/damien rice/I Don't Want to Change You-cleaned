Wherever you are
You know that I adore you
No matter how far
Well I can go before you
And if ever you need someone
Well not that you need helping
But if ever you want someone
Know that I am willing
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a strangers eye
Wherever you go
Well I can always follow
I can feed this real slow
If its a lot to swallow
And if you just want to be alone
Well I can wait without waiting
If you want me to let this go
Well Im more than willing
Cause I dont want to change you
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a strangers eye
And I dont want to change you
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Out among the danger
Somewhere in a strangers eye
Ive never been with anyone
In the way Ive been with you
But if love is not for fun
Then its doomed
Cause water races
Water races down the waterfalls
Water races
Water races down the waterfall
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change you
I dont want to change your mind
I just came across a manger
Where there is no danger
Where love has eyes and is not blind
