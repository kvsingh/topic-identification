Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
Its the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
Its the wrong time
For somebody new
Its a small crime
And I got no excuse
And is that all right yeah
Give my gun away when its loaded
That all right yeah
If you dont shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
That all right yeah
Give my gun away when its loaded
That all right yeah with you
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
Its the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you
Its the wrong time
Shes pulling me through
Its a small crime
And I got no excuse
And is that all right yeah
To give my gun away when its loaded
Is that all right yeah
If you dont shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that all right yeah
If I give my gun away when its loaded
Is that all right
That all right with you
That all right yeah
If I give my gun away when its loaded
Is that all right yeah
You dont shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that all right yeah
If I give my gun away when its loaded
Is that all right
Is that all right with you
And is that all right yeah
Is that all right yeah
Is that all right yeah
Is that all right Is that all right
Is that all right with you No
