Dont hold yourself like that
Youll hurt your knees
Well I kissed your mouth and back
But thats all I need
Dont build your world around
Volcanoes melt you down
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And Ill ask for the sea
Dont throw yourself like that
In front of me
I kissed your mouth your back
Is that all you need
Dont drag my love around
Volcanoes melt me down
What I am to you is not real
What I am to you you do not need
What I am to you is not what you mean to me
You give me miles and miles of mountains
And Ill ask for the sea
What I give to you
Is just what Im going through
This is nothing new no no
Just another phase of finding
What I really need
Is what makes me bleed
But like a new disease
Lord shes still too young to treat
What I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
What I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
What I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
What I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
What I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
And what I am to you  i
Is not real 
What I am to you  y
You do not need 
You do not need me
