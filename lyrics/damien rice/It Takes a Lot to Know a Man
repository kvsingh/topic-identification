[Verse 1]
It takes a lot to know a man
It takes a lot to understand
The warrior, the sage
The little boy in rage

It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to understand what's humming
The honey-bee, the stings
The little girl with wings

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to breathe
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

[Verse 2]
It takes a lot to know a man
A lot to know, to understand
The father and the son
The hunter and the gun

It takes a lot to know a woman
A lot to comprehend what's coming
The mother and the child
The muse and the beguiled

[Chorus]
It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

It takes a lot to give
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

It takes a lot to live
To ask for help
To be yourself
To know and love what you live with

It takes a lot to be
To touch, to feel
The slow reveal
Of what another body needs

What are you so afraid to lose?
What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
What are you so afraid to lose?
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you're so afraid so to lose?
It takes a lot to know a man...
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you're thinking that will happen if you do?
It takes a lot to know a man...
(You wrote me to tell me
You’re nervous and you’re sorry
Crying like a baby
Saying, “this thing is killing me”)

What is it you carry on your back?
It takes a lot to know a man...
What is it you notice when you can't laugh?
(Know you can, have to know)
(Killing me)
