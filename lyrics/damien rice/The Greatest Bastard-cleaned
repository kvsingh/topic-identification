I made you laugh I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes
Didnt I
I helped you open out your wings
Your legs and many other things
Didnt I
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
The only one who let you go
The one you hurt so much you cannot bear
Well we were good when we were good
When we were not misunderstood
You helped me love you helped me live
You helped me learn how to forgive
Didnt you
I wish that I could say the same
But when you left you left the blame
Didnt you
Am I the greatest bastard that you met
The only one you cant forget
Am I the one your truths been waiting for
Or am I just dreaming once again
Some dreams are better when they end
Some make it mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
We learn to wag and tuck our tails
We learn to win and then to fail
Didnt we
We learn that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling
Didnt we
Am I the greatest bastard that you know
When will we learn to let this go
We fought so much weve broken all the charm
But letting go is not the same
As pushing someone else away
So please dont let on
You dont know me
Please dont let on
Im not here
Please dont let on
You dont love me
Cause I know you do
I know
That some make it mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down
Some fret it forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant
