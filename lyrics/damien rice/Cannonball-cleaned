Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to see whats going on
Still a little bit of your ghost your witness
Still a little bit of your face I havent kissed
You step a little closer each day
That I cant say whats going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So its not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I cant see whats going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So its not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
So come on courage
Teach me to be shy
Cause its not hard to fall
And I dont wanna scare her
Its not hard to fall
And I dont wanna lose
Its not hard to grow
When you know that you just dont know
