[Verse 1]
Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth
Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt
Still a little hard to see what's going on
Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed

[Pre-Chorus]
You step a little closer each day
That I can't say what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannonball

[Verse 2]
Still a little bit of your song in my ear
Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
You step a little closer to me
So close that I can't see what's going on

[Chorus]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
And life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon

[Verse 3]
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
So come on courage!
Teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you just don't know
