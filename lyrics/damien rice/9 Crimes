[Verse: Lisa Hannigan]
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lisa Hannigan]
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I got no excuse

[Refrain: Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That all right, yeah?
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
That all right, yeah?
Give my gun away when it's loaded
That all right, yeah, with you?

[Verse: Damien Rice]
Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Damien Rice]
It's the wrong time
She's pulling me through
It's a small crime
And I got no excuse

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
To give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If you don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right?
That all right with you?

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
That all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right, yeah?
If I give my gun away when it's loaded
(Is that all right with you?)
Is that all right?
Is that all right with you?

[Refrain: Damien Rice & Lisa Hannigan]
And is that all right, yeah?
(To give my gun away when it's loaded)
Is that all right, yeah?
(You don't shoot it, how am I supposed to hold it?)
Is that all right, yeah?
(To give my gun away when it's loaded)
Is that all right? Is that all right?
Is that all right with you? No
