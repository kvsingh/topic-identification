If you want to hang out
Youve got to take her out
Cocaine
If you want to get down
Down on the ground
Cocaine
She dont lie
She dont lie
She dont lie
Cocaine
If you got bad news
You want to kick the blues
Cocaine
When your day is done
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
She dont lie
She dont lie
She dont lie
Cocaine
If your day is gone
And you want to ride on
Cocaine
Dont forget this fact
You cant get it back
Cocaine
She dont lie
She dont lie
She dont lie
Cocaine
She dont lie
She dont lie
She dont lie
Cocaine
