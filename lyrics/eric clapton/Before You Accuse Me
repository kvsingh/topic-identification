[Chorus]
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

[Verse 1]
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
I called your mama about three or four nights ago
Well your mother said
"Son, do not call my daughter no more"

[Chorus]
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else

[Verse 2]
Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
Come back home baby, try my love, one more time
If I don't go on and quit you
I'm going to lose my mind

[Chorus]
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself
You say I have been spending my money on other women
You've been taking money from someone else
