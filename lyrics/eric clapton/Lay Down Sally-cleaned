There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me
I know youve got somewhere to go
But wont you make yourself at home and stay with me
And dont you ever leave
Lay down Sally and rest you in my arms
Dont you think you want someone to talk to
Lay down Sally no need to leave so soon
Ive been trying all night long just to talk to you
Sun isnt nearly on the rise
We still got the moon and stars above
Underneath the velvet skies love is all that matters
Wont you stay with me Dont you ever leave
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily
So dont you go and say goodbye
You can lay your worries down and stay with me
Dont you ever leave
