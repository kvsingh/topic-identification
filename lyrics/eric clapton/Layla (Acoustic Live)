See if you can spot this one?

[Verse 1]
What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody is waiting by your side?
You have been running and hiding much too long
You know it is just your foolish pride

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 2]
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 3]
Let us make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please, don’t say we will never find a way
And tell me all my love in vain

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Chorus]
Layla, you’ve got me on my knees
Layla, I am begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

Thank you
