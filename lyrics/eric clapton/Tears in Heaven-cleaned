Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I dont belong here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven
Ill find my way through night and day
Because I know I just cant stay here in heaven
Time can bring you down time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart have you begging please begging please
Beyond the door theres peace Im sure
And I know therell be no more tears in heaven
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I dont belong here in heaven
