[Verse]
Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money, I just did not care
Took all my friends out for a good time
Bought bootleg whiskey, champagne and wine

Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends, I did not have nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
I'm going to hang on to it until that eagle grins

Because no, no, nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

[Chorus][x2]
When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old long-lost friend
Said it's mighty strange, without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
