Its late in the evening shes wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her makeup and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me Do I look all right
And I say Yes you look wonderful tonight
We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady thats walking around with me
And then she asks me Do you feel all right
And I say Yes I feel wonderful tonight
I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just dont realize how much I love you
Its time to go home now and Ive got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her as I turn out the light
I say My darling you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling you were wonderful tonight
