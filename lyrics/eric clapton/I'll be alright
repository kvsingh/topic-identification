I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright someday

If in my heart
I do not give
Then I'll be alright someday

I'll overcome
I'll overcome
I'll overcome someday

If in my heart
I do not give
Then I'll overcome someday

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home someday

If in my heart
I do not give
Then I’ll be going home someday
Lord I’ll be going home someday
