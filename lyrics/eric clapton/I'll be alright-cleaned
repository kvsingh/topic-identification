Ill be alright
Ill be alright
Ill be alright someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then Ill be alright someday
Ill overcome

Ill overcome someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then Ill overcome someday
Im going home
Im going home
Im going home someday
If in my heart
I do not give
Then I’ll be going home someday
Lord I’ll be going home someday
