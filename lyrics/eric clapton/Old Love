[Verse 1]
I can feel your body
When I'm lying in bed
There's too much confusion
Going around through my head

[Pre-Chorus]
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why can't I get over?
When will I ever learn?

[Chorus]
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home

[Verse 2]
I can see your face
But I know that it's not real
It's just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel

[Pre-Chorus]
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will alway burn
I'll never get over
I know that I'll never learn

[Chorus]
Old love, leave me alone
Old love, go on home
