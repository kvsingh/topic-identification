[Verse 1]
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?

[Verse 2]
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven
Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven?

[Verse 3]
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven?
I'll find my way through night and day
Because I know I just can't stay here in heaven

[Bridge]
Time can bring you down, time can bend your knees
Time can break your heart, have you begging please, begging please
Beyond the door there's peace I'm sure
And I know there'll be no more tears in heaven

[Verse 4]
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven?
Would you feel the same
If I saw you in heaven?

[Outro]
I must be strong and carry on
Because I know I don't belong here in heaven
