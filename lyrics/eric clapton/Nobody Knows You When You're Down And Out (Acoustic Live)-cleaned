Once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spent all my money I just did not care
Took all my friends out for a good time
Bought bootleg whiskey champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Lost all my good friends I did not have nowhere to go
I get my hands on a dollar again
Im going to hang on to it until that eagle grins
Because no no nobody knows you
When youre down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And as for friends you dont have any
When you finally get back up on your feet again
Everybody wants to be your old longlost friend
Said its mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody knows you when youre down and out
