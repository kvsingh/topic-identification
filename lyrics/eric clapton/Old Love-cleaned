I can feel your body
When Im lying in bed
Theres too much confusion
Going around through my head
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame still burns
Why cant I get over
When will I ever learn
Old love leave me alone
Old love go on home
I can see your face
But I know that its not real
Its just an illusion
Caused by how I used to feel
And it makes me so angry
To know that the flame will alway burn
Ill never get over
I know that Ill never learn
Old love leave me alone
Old love go on home
