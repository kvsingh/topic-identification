See if you can spot this one
What will you do when you get lonely
And nobody is waiting by your side
You have been running and hiding much too long
You know it is just your foolish pride
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
I tried to give you consolation
When your old man had let you down
Like a fool I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
Let us make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please don’t say we will never find a way
And tell me all my love in vain
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
Layla you’ve got me on my knees
Layla I am begging darling please Layla
Darling wont you ease my worried mind
Thank you
