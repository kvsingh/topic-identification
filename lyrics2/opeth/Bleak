[Verse 1: Mikael Akerfeldt]
Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding from the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight

[Chorus 1: Mikael]
Break of Morning, coldness lingers on
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun

[Verse 2: Mikael]
Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

[Chorus 2: Mikael]
Plunging towards bereavement faster yet
Clearing thoughts, my mind is set

[Bridge: Steven Wilson]
Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

[Verse 3: Mikael]
Help me cure you
Atone for all you've done
Help me leave you
As all the days are gone

[Bridge: Steven]
Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me
You're close to the final word
You're staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away
Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine
Night falls again
Taking whatâ€™s left of me

[Outro: Mikael]
Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need
