]
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me
And I let it all out to find
That I’m not the only person with these things in mind
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I’ve got left to feel
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I’m close to something real
I wanna find something I’ve wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
]
And I’ve got nothing to say
I can’t believe I didn’t fall right down on my face
Looking everywhere only to find
That it’s not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
What do I have but negativity?
’Cause I can’t justify the way everyone is looking at me
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I’m close to something real
I wanna find something I’ve wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I will never know myself
Until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else
Until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything
’Til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I’ve felt so long
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I’m close to something real
I wanna find something I’ve wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I’m somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I’m somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
