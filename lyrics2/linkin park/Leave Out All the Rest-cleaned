I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared
But no-one would listen, 'cause no-one else cared
After my dreaming, I woke with this fear
What am I leaving, when I'm done here?
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me and, when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Don't be afraid, I've taken my beating, I've shared what I've made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me and, when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting, all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending, someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
So, if you're asking me, I want you to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some, reasons to be missed
Don't resent me and when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest
Forgetting, all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending, someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are
