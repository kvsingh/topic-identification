[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I canâ€™t help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do
I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I let go, watching you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

[Chorus]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Chorus]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

[Outro]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
