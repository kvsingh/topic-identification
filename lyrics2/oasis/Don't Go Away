[Verse 1]
A cold and frosty morning there's not a lot to say
About the things caught in my mind
As the day was dawning my plane flew away
With all the things caught in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna be there when you're... coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

[Verse 2]
Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
About the things caught in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna be there when you're... coming down
And I wanna be there when you hit the ground

[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

[Middle 8]
Me and you what's going on?
All we seem to know is how to show
The feelings that are wrong

[Chorus 1]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

[Chorus 2]
So don't go away
Say what you say
Say that you'll stay
Forever and a day
In the time of my life
'Cause I need more time
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right
Yes I need more time
Just to make things right

[Outro]
So don't go away
