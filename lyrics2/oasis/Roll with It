[Chorus]
You've gotta roll with it
You've gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me

[Post-Chorus]
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside
I think I'm gonna take me away and hide
I'm thinking of things that I just can't abide

[Verse 1]
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before

[Chorus]
You've gotta roll with it
You've gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I know the roads down which your life will drive
I find the key that lets you slip inside
Kiss the girl, she's not behind the door
But you know I think I recognize your face
But I've never seen you before

[Chorus]
You gotta roll with it
You gotta take your time
You gotta say what you say
Don't let anybody get in your way
'Cause it's all too much for me to take

Don't ever stand aside
Don't ever be denied
You wanna be who you'd be
If you're coming with me

[Outro]
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside (Take me away)
