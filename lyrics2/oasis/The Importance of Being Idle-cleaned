I sold my soul for the second time
Cause the man don't pay me
I begged my landlord for some more time
He said: "son, the bills are waiting"
My best friend called me the other night
He said: "man, are you crazy?"
My girlfriend told me to get a life
She said: "boy, you're lazy"
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
I lost my faith in the summer time
Cause it don't stop raining
The sky all day is as black as night
But I'm not complaining
I begged my doctor for one more line
He said: "Son, words fail me"
It ain't no place to be killing time
I guess I'm just lazy
But I don't mind
As long as there's a bed beneath the stars that shine
I'll be fine
If you give me a minute
A man's got a limit
I can't get a life if my heart's not in it
