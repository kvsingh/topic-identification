[Verse 1]
Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Sometimes I grow so tired, but I know I've got one thing I got to do

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Verse 2]
Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And tho' our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on

[Chorus]
Ramble on
And now the time, the time is now
To sing my song
I'm going around the world, I got to find my girl
On my way
I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on
Gotta find the queen of all my dreams

[Bridge]
I tell you no lie

[Verse 3]
Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
T'was in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one
Crept up and slipped away with her, her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

[Outro]
Rambling
I'm gonna
Shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way going round the world, baby baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do
Baby baby baby baby baby
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I
I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby
