In my time of dying
I want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus going to make up
You know
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed
Meet me, Jesus, meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
If my wings should fail me, Lord
O' please meet me with another pair
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Oh, oh
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus, going to make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh
Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed
Oh, Saint Peter
At the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in
I never did no harm
I never did no wrong
Oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm
Did no harm
I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong
No, not once
Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good
Oh, did somebody some good
I must have did somebody some good
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces
And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh, Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
You can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Hear the angels marching, hear them marching, hear them marching
Hear them marching, the marching
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
Oh my Jesus, oh my Jesus
It's pretty good up here
Oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina, oh Georgina
Oh I'll see you again
Oh, don't you make it my dying, dying, dying
Cough
That's gotta be the one, ain't it?
Come have a listen then
Oh yes, thank you
