[Refrain]
Been working from seven to eleven every night
Really makes life a drag
I don't think that's right

[Verse 1]
I've really been the best, the best of fools
I did what I could, yeah
Cause I love you baby
How I love you darling
How I love you, baby
My beloved little girl, little girl

[Hook]
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Everybody trying to tell me
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you I really did the best I could

[Refrain]
I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag
Lord, yeah, that ain't right

[Hook]
Since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose my worried mind
Watch out

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

[Verse 3]
Do you remember mama
When I knocked upon your door?
I said you had the nerve to tell me
You didn't want me no more, yeah
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them
New fangled, new fangled back door men

[Refrain]
I've been working from
Seven, seven, seven, to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag
Yeah, it makes it a drag

[Hook]
Baby, since I've been loving you, yeah
I'm about to lose, I'm about to lose my worried mind
Oh yeah
Just one more, just one more, oooh, yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind
