I'm blind from the tears that fall like rain
So lost ever since you went away
Sometimes our lives forever change
My heart's never gonna be the same
Cause you came
And you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
I try every night to turn the page
But daylight can't confine me to a cage
In my mind the life we had replays
Now every where I turn I see your face
Cause you came
And you gave me a place
Place to lay all my pain
Why'd you take it away?
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
You never, you never, you never, you never
You never know what you got til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's gone
All the memories I'm saving
So your love is never fading
Holding on my heart is breaking
Can't let go
You never know what you got 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's, 'til it's
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
Til it's gone, gone, gone, gone
You never know what you got 'til it's
Got 'til it's, got 'til it's, got 'til it's gone
