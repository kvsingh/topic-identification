What?
Say you feel alone, that your day was the baddest
Tellin' me you can’t sleep because of your mattress
Do you wanna come over? 
Do you wanna come over? 
Let me rub your back, you can set limitations
Honey, if you want, you can get out frustrations
Do you wanna come over? 
Do you wanna come over? 
Cause nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be
So...
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Do you wanna come over?
I could get into that kissin' and touchin'
Or we could be good and do next to nothin’
Do you wanna come over? 
Do you wanna come over? 
'Cuz all I want is what you want
And all you want is me
Yeah, all you want is what I want
And all I want is you 
'Cuz nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don’t have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be
So...
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Do you wanna come over?
Do you want to come over, come over?
'Cuz all I want is what you I want
And all you want is me
Yeah, all you want is what I want
And all I want is you
Just come over
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you need 
I do it 
I do it 
Do you wanna come over?
Do you want to come over? 
Come over? Uh huh
Do you want to come over? 
Come over? 
Do you wanna come over?
