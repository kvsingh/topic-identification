Tall tales, such a damn shame
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
Collecting the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
 It's too late for apologies
 Nothing you can offer me now
 I'm looking at you on your knees
 And I'm all listened out
Call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
I hear you all night, talk in your sleep
Saying all kinda names but none of them me
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets
You can cry wolf
But you know I ain’t gon' be here tomorrow, oh no
I ain’t fuckin' wit ya dirty, dirty-dirty laundry
 It's too late for apologies
 Nothing you can offer me now
 I'm looking at you on your knees
 And I'm all listened out
Call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Here we go 
You can call, call, call
But I'm never gonna come
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can plead
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
You're a liar, a liar
