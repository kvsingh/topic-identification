[Intro]
Just luv me (just luv me)
Just luv me

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna ask for a sip when I'm thirsty
And you don't have to hold my hand when I'm hurting
Won't make you sober me up when I'm turning
And you don't gotta say it, I know that I'm worthy

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me

[Verse 2]
If you think that I'm saying it because I'm high maintenance
Like I'm trying to mask every problem that I'm facing
Well you're wrong cause I don't need nobody when I'm breaking
All I need is your luv and a little bit of patience

[Pre-Chorus]
You could ask me for a sorry
And a calm before the storm
Ask for pieces of my body
Until all of it was yours

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me

I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me

[Bridge]
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
Oh no, I won't ask you for nothing
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me, just luv me
I'ma keep it simple, real simple
Just luv me, just luv me, just luv me

[Outro]
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
Oh no, I won't ask you for nothing
Oh no, I won't, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise
I'm not gonna ask you for nothing
Just luv me (Just luv me)
