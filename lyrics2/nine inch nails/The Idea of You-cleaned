Maybe that was somebody else
Maybe, I was somebody else
I'm somebody, for what that's worth, if that means anything anymore
I think there's something just wrong with me
I have been wondering, when did you know?
You know, really know?
No no no no, I don't think that's going to happen here
You missed all that on the way out
Remember, I don't want to remember anymore
Maybe I was somebody else?
Just go back to the idea of me
Just go back to the idea of me
Just go back to the idea of me
Just-
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
Oh and
If I start to tell you anything, please don't pay attention
That's not really me in there, I would never do that
Just go back to the idea of me
Go back to that idea
Can you even hear me over here?
Can't you feel it happening?
Everything absorbing liquid twitching forming something terrible
The sores are gone
And you can hardly tell now but
There was someone else who isn't here anymore
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
 None of this
 Is happening
Hey! Wait! Can you hear? 
It gets  so lonely in here
