[Verse 1]
Split
Split into
Something else
Shed
Your precious skin
Save yourself
Bleed
Have to purge
What you were
Yes
Yes, of course
This is gonna hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Nature is violent
The very nature of this is violence
No no no no no that was someone else
No no no no no no no that wasn't me

[Chorus]
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart

[Verse 2]
Thrive
Just become
Your disease
Leave
Them behind
You are free
Take
What you want
What you deserve
Yes
Yes, of course
This is gonna hurt

[Chorus]
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart

[Outro]
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know
