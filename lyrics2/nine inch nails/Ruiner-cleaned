You had all of them on your side, didn't you? Didn't you?
You believed in all your lies, didn't you? Didn't you?
The ruiner's got a lot to prove
He's got nothing to lose and now he made you believe
The ruiner's your only friend
Well he's the living end to the cattle he deceives
The raping of the innocent
You know the ruiner ruins everything he sees
Now the only pure thing left in my fucking world is wearing your disease
How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did it get so hard?
How did it get so long?
You had to give them all a sign, didn't you? Didn't you?
You had to covet what was mine, didn't you?  Didn't you?
The ruiner's a collector
He's an infector serving his shit to his flies
Maybe there will come a day
When those that you keep blind will suddenly realize
Maybe it's a part of me you took to a place I hoped it would never go
And maybe that fucked me up much more than you'll ever know
How did you get so big?
How did you get so strong?
How did you get so hard?
How did it get so long?
What you gave to me
My perfect ring of scars
You know I can see
What you really are
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop me now
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can hurt me
You didn't hurt me
Nothing can stop
