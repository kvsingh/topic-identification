He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
He tries to tell me what I put inside of me
He's got the answers to ease my curiosity
He dreamed a god up and called it Christianity
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
He flexed his muscles to keep his flock of sheep in line
He made a virus that would kill off all the swine
His perfect kingdom of killing, suffering and pain
Demands devotion atrocities done in his name
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
Your God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I will see you there
God is dead and no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
God is dead
And no one cares
If there is a hell I'll see you there
Burning with your god in humility
Will you die for this?
