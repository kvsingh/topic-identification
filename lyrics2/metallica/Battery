[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus 1]
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

[Chorus 2]
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

[Chorus 3]
Cannot kill the family
Battery has found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never ending potency
Hungry violence seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus 1]
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

[Chorus 2]
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

[Choruse 3]
Cannot kill the family
Battery has found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 3]
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

[Chorus 1]
Smashing through the boundaries
Lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery

[Chorus 2]
Pounding out aggression
Turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery

[Chorus 3]
Cannot kill the family
Battery has found in me
Battery, battery
