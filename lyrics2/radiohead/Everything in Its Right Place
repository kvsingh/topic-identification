[Intro]
Kid A, Kid A
Kid A, Kid A
God sent a spark

[Chorus]
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon
Yesterday I woke up sucking a lemon

[Chorus]
Everything
Everything
Everything
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

[Verse 2]
There are two colours in my head
There are two colours in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say

[Outro]
Everything
Everything
Everything
