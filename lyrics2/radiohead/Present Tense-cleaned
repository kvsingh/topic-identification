This dance
This dance
Is like a weapon
Is like a weapon
Of self-defence
Of self-defence
Against the present
Against the present
The present tense
No I won't get heavy
No don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'll be dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around
Or the penny drops
Won't stop now
Won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
To stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business
But mine
Where all this love
Has been in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
