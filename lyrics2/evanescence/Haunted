[Verse 1]
Long lost words whisper slowly to me
Still can't find what keeps me here
When all this time I've been so hollow inside
I know you're still there

[Chorus]
Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you, loving you
I won't let you pull me down

[Verse 2]
Hunting you, I can smell you alive
Your heart pounding in my head
Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me, raping me, watching me

[Chorus]
Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you, loving you
I won't let you pull me down
