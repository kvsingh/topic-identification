Hold on to me, love
You know I can't stay long
All I wanted to say was
"I love you and I'm not afraid"
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me in your arms?
Holding my last breath
Safe inside myself
Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight
I'll miss the winter
A world of fragile things
Look for me in the white forest
Hiding in a hollow tree 
I know you hear me
I can taste it in your tears
Closing your eyes to disappear
You pray your dreams will leave you here
But still you wake and know the truth
No one is there
Say goodnight
Don't be afraid
Calling me, calling me
As you fade to black
 Holding my last breath
 Safe inside myself
 Are all my thoughts of you?
Sweet raptured light, it ends here tonight
