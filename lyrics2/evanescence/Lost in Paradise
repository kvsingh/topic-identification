[Verse 1]
I've been believing
In something so distant
As if I was human

And I've been denying
This feeling of hopelessness
In me, in me

[Pre-Hook]
All the promises I made
Just to let you down
You believed in me
But I'm broken

[Hook]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

[Verse 2]
As much as I'd like
The past not to exist
It still does

And as much as I'd like
To feel like I belong here
I'm just as scared as you

[Hook]
I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

[Bridge]
Run away
Run away
One day we won't feel
This pain anymore

Take it all away
Shadows of you
Cause they won't let me go

[Coda]
Until I have nothing left
And all I feel is this cruel wanting
We've been falling for all this time
And now I'm lost in paradise

Alone and lost in paradise
