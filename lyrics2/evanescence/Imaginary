[Intro]
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, paper flowers)
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, paper flowers)

[Verse 1]
I linger in the doorway
Of alarm clock screaming
Monsters calling my name
Let me stay
Where the wind will whisper to me
Where the raindrops, as they’re falling, tell a story

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby (flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me (flowers)

[Verse 2]
Don’t say I’m out of touch
With this rampant chaos - your reality
I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge
The nightmare I built my own world to escape

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby (flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me (flowers)

[Verse 3]
Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming
Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights
Oh, how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
The goddess of imaginary light

[Chorus]
In my field of paper flowers
And candy clouds of lullaby (flowers)
I lie inside myself for hours
And watch my purple sky fly over me (flowers)

[Outro]
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, paper flowers)
(Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, paper flowers)
