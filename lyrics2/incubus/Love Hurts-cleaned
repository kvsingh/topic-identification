Tonight we drink to youth
And holding fast to truth
I don’t want to lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA
Sometimes when I’m alone, I wonder
Is it a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing
Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I’m alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
Because without love, I won’t survive
I’m fettered and abused
I stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one man submarine
I only want the truth
So tonight, we drink to youth
I’ll never lose what I had as a boy
Love hurts
Love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
Love hurts
Without love I won’t survive
