[Verse 1]
Take a bow
Pack on powder
Wash them out with buzzing lights
Pay an audience to care
Impress me personality

[Pre-Chorus]
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming of your face
Enjoy you from the chemical
Comfort of America

[Chorus]
Come one, come all
Into 1984
Yeah, three, two, one
Lights, camera, transaction

[Verse 2]
Quick, your time is almost up
Make all forget that they're the moth
Edging in towards the flame
Burn into obscurity

[Pre-Chorus]
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming up your fate
And judge you from a card castle
Comfort of America

[Chorus x4]
Come one, come all
Into 1984
Yeah, three, two, one
Lights, camera, transaction

[Outro]
Your foundation is canyoning
Fault lines should be worn with pride
I hate to say
You're so much more
You're so much more
Endearing with the sound turned off
