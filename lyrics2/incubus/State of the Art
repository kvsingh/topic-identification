[Verse 1]
You were the first in flight, now a modern relic
Merely a payphone on a one AM sidewalk
We're all cast aside and we're antiquated
Right as we start to finally figure out what we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at you so bright, state of the art
You're new, you're young, your blissful ignorance
Is everything they like, but the years have teeth
And sometimes they bite

[Chorus]
Look at you, you're falling apart
Built to spill, you're state of the art
Now look at you, well look at you now

[Verse 2]
Now do you see that smile at the foot of the ladder
Ain't it familiar? That was you only yesterday
But this justice feels more like a poison apple
And inevitably everyone'll bite into it

[Pre-Chorus]
Now look at you so bright, state of the art
You're new, you're young, your blissful ignorance
Is everything they like, but the years have teeth
And sometimes they bite

[Chorus]
Look at you, you're falling apart
Built to spill, you're state of the art
Now look at you, well look at you now

[Bridge]
I'm falling, I'm falling apart
The state of, the state of the art

[Chorus]
Look at you, you're falling apart
Built to spill, you're state of the art
Now look at you, well look at you now
Look at you, you're falling apart
Built to spill, you're state of the art
Yeah look at you, well look at you now

[Outro]
State of the art
State of the art
Look at you so bright
State of the art
