Feels familiar
When the knife gets buried into my beating heart
Then I come to
Bloody, bruised, and cursing my own naivet√©
I was on an empty beach
On a screaming all-time low
I remember meeting you and sharing all these injustices
Let me help she said
I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
Yeah
Please release me
Helping hands aren't supposed to cut off my oxygen
And why won't you hear me
When I'm screaming at the top of my voice?
Now I remember why I'm alone
I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
'Cause you're a, a glitterbomb
 a glitterbomb
There's only you and I in here
And one of us is acting crazy
There's only you and I in here
And one of us...
I was your friend and ended up your victim, yeah
I ended up your victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
'Cause you're a, a glitterbomb
 a glitterbomb
