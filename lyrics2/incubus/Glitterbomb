[Verse 1]
Feels familiar
When the knife gets buried into my beating heart
Then I come to
Bloody, bruised, and cursing my own naivet√©

I was on an empty beach
On a screaming all-time low
I remember meeting you and sharing all these injustices
Let me help she said

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know

[Chorus]
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim

Yeah

[Verse 2]
Please release me
Helping hands aren't supposed to cut off my oxygen
And why won't you hear me
When I'm screaming at the top of my voice?
Now I remember why I'm alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I shoulda known better
I know
I shoulda known better
Yeah I know

[Chorus]
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim

[Bridge]
'Cause you're a, a glitterbomb
('Cause you're a) a glitterbomb

There's only you and I in here
And one of us is acting crazy
There's only you and I in here
And one of us...(one of us)

[Chorus]
I was your friend and ended up your victim, yeah
I ended up your victim
I was your friend and ended up your victim, victim

[Outro]
'Cause you're a, a glitterbomb
('Cause you're a) a glitterbomb
