Girl I wanna kiss you, but not just on your lips no
The tips of your fingers and every intersection, start again down at your pinkie toe
Can you tell I miss you from my cadence and tempo?
Lips are a trigger and maybe this connection is a point we should be aiming for
Could we make up
Could we make out
I get high every time I get the taste of you on my tongue
And I know you’re one to hold onto
Deep sigh every time I get a hint of you in my mind
Cause I know you won’t be held onto
Babe I’ve got a weakness for the backs of your knees your honey spilt over
And now I am an army of ants and we’re all thinking the same thought
Let me introduce you to my slippery fingers
I get high every time I get the taste of you on my tongue
And I know you’re one to hold onto
Deep sigh every time I get a hint of you in my mind
Cause I know you won’t be held onto
