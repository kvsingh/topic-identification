Take a bow
Pack on powder
Wash them out with buzzing lights
Pay an audience to care
Impress me personality
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming of your face
Enjoy you from the chemical
Comfort of America
Come one, come all
Into 1984
Yeah, three, two, one
Lights, camera, transaction
Quick, your time is almost up
Make all forget that they're the moth
Edging in towards the flame
Burn into obscurity
Still and transfixed
The electric sheep are dreaming up your fate
And judge you from a card castle
Comfort of America
Come one, come all
Into 1984
Yeah, three, two, one
Lights, camera, transaction
Your foundation is canyoning
Fault lines should be worn with pride
I hate to say
You're so much more
You're so much more
Endearing with the sound turned off
