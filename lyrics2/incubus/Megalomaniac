[Verse 1]
I hear you on the radio
You permeate my screen, it's unkind but
If I met you in a scissor fight
I'd cut off both your wings on principle alone
On principle alone

[Chorus]
Hey megalomaniac
You're no Jesus
Yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean of yourself baby
Maniac, step down, step down

[Verse 2]
If I were your appendages
I'd hold open your eyes
So you would see
That all of us are heaven sent
There was never meant to be only one
To be only one

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yeah
You're no Jesus
You're no Elvis
You're no Jesus
You're no Jesus
You're no Elvis
You're no answer
Step down, step down
Step down, step down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Step down, step down [x2]
