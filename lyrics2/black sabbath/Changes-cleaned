I feel unhappy
I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend
That I ever had
She was my woman
I love her so
But it's too late now
I've let her go
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
We shared the years
We shared each day
In love together
We found the way
But soon the world
Had its evil ways
My heart was blinded
Love went to stray
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
It took so long
To realize
And I can still hear
Her last goodbyes
Now all my days
Are filled with tears
Wish I could go back
And change these years
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
