[Verse 1: Ozzy Osbourne]
Precious cups within the flower
Deadly petals with strange power
Faces shine a deadly smile
Look upon you at your trial

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
Chill that numbs from head to toe
Icy sun with frosty glow
Words that glow read to your sorrow
Words that glow read, "no tomorrow"

[Bridge: Ozzy Osbourne]
Feel your spirit rise with the breeze
Feel your body falling to its knees
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Turns your body to a corpse
Sleeping wall of remorse
Turns your body to a corpse

[Guitar Solo: Tony Iommi]

[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of sleep is cool and bright
Wall of sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you have awoken
