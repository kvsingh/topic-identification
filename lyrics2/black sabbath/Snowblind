[Verse 1: Ozzy Osbourne]
What you get and what you see
Things that don't come easily
Feeling happy in my vein
Icicles within my brain (Cocaine)

[Verse 2: Ozzy Osbourne]
Something blowing in my head
Winter's ice, it soon will spread
Death would freeze my very soul
Makes me happy, makes me cold

[Verse 3: Ozzy Osbourne]
My eyes are blind, but I can see
The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel the snowflakes freezing me

[Guitar Solo: Tony Iommi]

[Verse 4: Ozzy Osbourne]
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling go

[Bridge: Ozzy Osbourne]
Don't you think I know what I'm doing?
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really a loser
This is where I feel I belong

[Outro: Ozzy Osbourne]
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?
