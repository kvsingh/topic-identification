[1. Verse]
I'm onto you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better the ones you make believe

All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams

[1. Chorus]
Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs

[2. Verse]
I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived

I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream

[2. Chorus]
You won't have to wait long
They've shown up again
Make way for the fall

[3. Verse]
Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who're you gonna call when you wake up?

See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board

[1. Bridge]
If this is entertaining
I hope you all enjoy the view

Wide awake
But still asleep

I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
But still asleep

[4. Verse]
Don't leave this too long
(It won't take long)
Tomorrow will come
(Hang around)
You won't have to wait long
(We'll rise up again)
It's your day in the sun

[Outro]
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again

Please wake up
Please wake up
