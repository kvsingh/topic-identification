For what it's worth, I feel it slip away
I've become immune, woke up in a daze
Show me what you mean, take away from me
Everything I have, everything I need
Suck me dry

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
For the last time please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my
It's rising

So now it seems that you push me away
Further than I've been, but not too far to stay
Here where I belong, where my soul can rest
I need time to heal, I need time to see
You've sucked me dry

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted
For the last time please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my
It's rising

And so you emerge, like a butterfly
But so dangerously are you, BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT
DROWN ME IN THE SHADOWS WON'T YOU?
YOU WALK AWAY, I LOOK AWAY..

Lift me up I want to see
Then drag me down from everything
In this I cannot see the end
And I will only be your friend

TEARS DROP AND MY EYES CLOSE (x3)
TEARS DROP AND MY EYES...

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? YOU'RE THE PROBLEM NOW

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted

You don't come, you don't write, you don't listen
I'm a messenger sent and I know it's in my head
My mind's wasted

For the last time please pull me under
I can take anything and I know it's in my...
It's rising...
