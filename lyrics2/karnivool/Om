"What do you think of it?

To do this in two minutes, eternity in an hour
It's almost impossible, of course, to describe it
You can only say: It isn't, it isn't
Trying to tell people what it is
Well of course, I don't know any of our friends which haven't said
This one thing in common
Well, I never knew anything like this in the whole of my life
And one or two people have said to me, I've said it to myself
That's what death is going to be like, and oh what fun it would be!

How do you mean that?

Well i mean that there are the colours, the beauties, the designs
The beautiful ways which things appear
People themselves, common people, appear fascinating
Intressing, mysterious, wonderful
But death's only the beginning
Suddenly you notice there aren't these separations
That we're not on a seperate island shouting across to somebody
Else and trying to hear what they're saying, and misunderstanding
You know, you use the word yourself
Empathy
This thing's flowing underneath, we're parts of a single constant
It meets underneath the rock
And with that goes such delight, a sober certainty of wainting bliss."
