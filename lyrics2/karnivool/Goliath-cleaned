I'm onto you
I've seen your ways
Show yourself
Better the ones you make believe
All I hear
Is the sound of sleep
Deafening
Comfort in the arms of sweet dreams
Now, this won't take long
We'll rise up again
And rewrite these wrongs
I won't do it
I've rushed you
Patiently
Guarding the life that you deceived
I've crawled for you
Or so they say
We rise to it
Fall again into the same dream
You won't have to wait long
They've shown up again
Make way for the fall
Wake up
There's blood in your sweat when you wake up
Cower, bloodsucking liar
Who're you gonna call when you wake up?
See now
What you gonna see when you wake up?
Beg, you little fucking liar
Your head on this chopping board
If this is entertaining
I hope you all enjoy the view
Wide awake
But still asleep
I'm failing this riddle in my head, I
I'm failing to get it
Can you say?
Honestly?
Wide awake
But still asleep
Don't leave this too long
Tomorrow will come
You won't have to wait long
It's your day in the sun
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
They've shown up again
Please wake up
Please wake up
