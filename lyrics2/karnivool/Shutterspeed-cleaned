Leave me alone
I'm seethin'
I search for the truth and love in your eyes
Help me to feel I'm needed
I search for the truth to find you mine
Bust myself back into pieces, I
Pull at the seam as you start to tear
Lead myself back to a coma shell
No better face left too bare
I see more than you
And I feel more than you
You're spinning me out
It's a better room now, it's a better place, I
I would beg you to scream at me
The voices cry, the fashion mould
They want the truth, not what it seems
Speak to me now
With guarded tongue
See through me now
Look what you've done
I see more than you
And I feel more than you
Scrape me from the ceiling
These suckers want more
I feel the pressure belonging to all
Put fear into my mind
I'm open to everything 
I feel the strength of you
Give me this feeling I need, yeah
I feel more than you
