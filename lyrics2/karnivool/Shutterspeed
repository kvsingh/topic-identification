[1. Verse]
Leave me alone
I'm seethin'
I search for the truth and love in your eyes
Help me to feel I'm needed
I search for the truth to find you mine

[1. Bridge]
Bust myself back into pieces, I
Pull at the seam as you start to tear
Lead myself back to a coma shell
No better face left too bare

[1. Chorus]
I see more than you
And I feel more than you
You're spinning me out

[2. Verse]
It's a better room now, it's a better place, I
I would beg you to scream at me
The voices cry, the fashion mould
They want the truth, not what it seems

[1. Bridge]

[1. Chorus]

[2. Bridge]
Speak to me now
With guarded tongue
See through me now
Look what you've done

[2. Chorus]
I see more than you
And I feel more than you

[3. Verse]
Scrape me from the ceiling
These suckers want more
I feel the pressure belonging to all
Put fear into my mind
I'm open to everything (than you)
I feel the strength of you
Give me this feeling I need, yeah

[Outro]
(It's a better room now)
(It's a better place)

I feel more than you
