Subtle waves in motion
Shaping spirals upon the ground
Where are eyes are drawn
A circular door forms

Here we go our minds recoil
Out of control in this spinning wheel
We're starting to face what we've feared
What we can't ignore

It's starting to swell
This is bigger than you
Who thought it could be
Something beautiful
It's beginning to feel
Like we're part of something real

Red eyes shift
To signal the sun raises its
Phoenix call to fracture my sleep
Now the shaking sky
Means the shows just starting
We'll awake to carry the weight
Of the promises
I feel it taking over
I feel it taking over

I'm feeling opaque as
My colours all fade to grey
Here in the light of my darkest day
It's silent
I center my thoughts so maybe
I can relax into my sigh
My minds always window shopping
But I can't afford the payments
Feel like I've wasted my last chance
To try
Wait
Here in this moment
A pivotal moment
It's taking me over

It's starting to swell
This is bigger than you
Who thought it could be
Something beautiful
It's beginning to feel
Like we're part of something real
