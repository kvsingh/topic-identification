WE ARE A BROKEN WRUNG
WE BOTH COMPOSE THE WRECKAGE

There ain't nothin' you can say to prove
I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This isn't possible

So if there's any doubt
I will throw you a line
Excuses, excuses
Don't ever remind me
How it is and always will be

WE ARE A BROKEN WRUNG
WE BOTH COMPOSE THE WRECKAGE

There ain't nothin' you can say to prove
That I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This isn't possible

You've been this way before
The shadows here all know you
I don't know what you've had
Or what it is inside you
But we are all around you
We are all around you
We are all around you

If love comes first
Maybe our lies will dissolve
Young fruit, still not bruised
Hey, maybe, just maybe
We all make our moves
Mine could've helped you
I could've helped you

WE ARE A BROKEN WRUNG
WE BOTH COMPOSE THE WRECKAGE

WE ARE A BROKEN WRUNG
WE BOTH COMPOSE THE WRECKAGE

There ain't nothing you can say to prove
That I held the rope that let you down
As we crash into the waves and drown
This isn't possible
This is impossible
