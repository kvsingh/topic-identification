Anchor the night, open the sky
Hide in the hours before sunrise
Pray for me not, I won't lose sight
Of where I belong and where you lie
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Shipwreck the sun, well, I'm on your side
An army of one, onward we will ride
Whisper your songs, birds to the air
We'll bury all of our burdens there
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
For the best time you had
Best time you had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
Well, Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
Heaven's dead when you get sad
I see wishes fly
Out of time
For the best time you've had
I'll take it all, arrows or guns
Hundreds more to save you from one
To save you from one
To save you from one
To save you from one
Heaven's dead when you get sad
