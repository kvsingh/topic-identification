[Verse 1]
Hey Ah Na Na, innocence is over
Hey Ah Na Na, over
Hey Ah Na Na, ignorance is spoken
Hey Ah Na Na, spoken
Hey Ah Na Na, confidence is broken
Hey Ah Na Na, broken
Hey Ah Na Na, sustenance is stolen
Hey Ah Na Na, stolen
Hey Ah Na Na, arrogance is potent
Hey Ah Na Na, potent, yeah

[Chorus]
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawling back to start

[Verse 2]
Hey Ah Na Na, I repent tomorrow
Hey Ah Na Na, tomorrow
Hey Ah Na Na, I suspend my sorrow
Hey Ah Na Na, sorrow, yeah

[Chorus]
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawling back to start

[Verse 3]
Hey Ah Na Na, a romance is fallen
Hey Ah Na Na, fallen
Hey Ah Na Na, recommend you borrow
Hey Ah Na Na, borrow, yeah

[Chorus]
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawling back to start

[Outro]
Hey Ah Na Na (4x)
