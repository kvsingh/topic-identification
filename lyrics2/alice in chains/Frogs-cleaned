What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused?
All included but you, slone
The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue
Why's it have to be this way, be this way
Be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way
Flowers watched through wide eyes bloom
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon
Why's it have to be this way, be this way
Be this way, be this way, be this way, be this way
At 7 am on a Tuesday in August
Next week I'll be 28
I'm still young, it'll be me
Off the wall I scraped you
I gotta wake
I gotta wake, it comes this way
I can't wait no more
It comes this way, it comes this way
To drown this ache
To reinstate 
 Take your place 
Heaven direct your shape 
Your expiration date
Your expiration date, fate, date
Expiration date
This one is gonna last too, hate
Never gonna fuck with me again
Mans own clean slate
Don't fuck with me again
Makes your eyes dilate
Makes you shake
Irate
