[Verse 1]
I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control
I want you to kill me
And dig me under, I want to live no more

[Chorus]
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me

[Verse 2]
I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me

[Chorus]
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt

[Chorus]
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
