[Intro]
"Sure God's all powerful, but does he have lips? Whoa..."

[Verse 1]
Dear god, how have you been then?
I'm not fine, fuck pretending
All of this death your sending
Best throw some free heart mending
Invite you in my heart, then
When done, my sins forgiven?
This god of mine relaxes
World dies I still pay taxes

[Chorus]
Can I be as my god am
Can you be as god am
Can I be as my god am
God of all my god am

[Verse 2]
So lord, I see you grinning
Must be grand always winning
How proud are you being able
To gather faith from fable

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
All the respect I'm giving
Shared strength acquired by living
All blooming life you're feeding
Can't hide sick ones you're weeding

[Chorus]
