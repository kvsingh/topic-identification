She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade
Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous
