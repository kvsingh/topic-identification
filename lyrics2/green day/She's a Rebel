[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

[Verse 1]
From Chicago to Toronto
She's the one that they call ol' Whatsername
She's the symbol of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

[Verse 2]
Is she dreaming what I'm thinking?
Is she the mother of all bombs? Gonna detonate
Is she trouble like I'm trouble?
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody

[Bridge]
She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

[Chorus]
She's a rebel, she's a saint
She's the salt of the earth and she's dangerous
She's a rebel, vigilante
Missing link on the brink of destruction

[Outro]
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
She's a rebel
And she's dangerous
