Walking after dark in a New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy in the holiest of old
Onward Christian soldiers filled with jivin' mind-control
The blood left on the dancefloor running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
The voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind

Walking after dark in the New York City park
Beer Goggles left in the club, a pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah in the century of thrills
The blood left on the dancefloor running, running red
The bullet that you asked for killing you to death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Hold him underwater 'till that motherfucker drowns
We are the vultures, the dirtiest kind
They culture wars, in your heart and your mind

Someone's gonna get you boy
Shoot that fucker down!

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark...)
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot that fucker down
WOW!

Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, Shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying, "Shoot that fucker down!"
