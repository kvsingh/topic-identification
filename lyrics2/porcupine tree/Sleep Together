[Intro]
This means out
This is your way out
Do or drown
Do or drown in torpor

[Verse]
Leave no trace
All my files erased
Burn my clothes
Burn my Prada trainers

[Chorus]
Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever

[Verse]
This is fate
This is your escape
Leave here now
Leave here like it's over

[Chorus]
Let's sleep together right now
Relieve the pressure somehow
Switch off the future right now
Let's leave forever
